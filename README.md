Instructions:
  1. Follow the link and download all of the data click [Download All] if you scroll down.
  2. Make sure to download all necessary packages. 
  3. Fill out the filepaths in the huggingface.py file which are seperated by ejecta, oldcrater, and none.
  4. When filling out the training filepaths you can use any of the 4 none files but I chose the none_train1 file.
  5. Fill out the filepaths for where you will save your new CSV files preferrably the same place your toher data is at for consistency.
  6. Check out the To Do: section at the bottom to see a few notes I took in TA hours with Peter on next steps to make sure we are on track.
  7. Please play around with the data and familiarize yourself with the code and think about the model/anaylsis we can do with this data.
  8. If you are lost please check out homework 1 and 2 since the data should be in a format compatible with the code there.

NOTE: I am using UV and not Conda which shouldn't be an issue but if it is I suggest switching to UV anyway since its much better.
