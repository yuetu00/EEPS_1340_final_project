Our project applied supervised machine learning techniques to classify lunar surface features, specifically distinguishing between fresh craters, old craters, and non-cratered terrain, using a dataset derived from LROC NAC images.We used PCA for dimensionality reduction and trained various models including KNN, Random Forest, SVM, and AdaBoost.
